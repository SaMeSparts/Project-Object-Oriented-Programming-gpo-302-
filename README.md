# TransporTEC


The problem came from seeing how transportation companies often don’t manage their vehicles very well. Many still use spreadsheets or old software to keep track of cars, drivers, and routes. Doing things by hand like this causes mistakes, missed vehicle check-ups, and wastes time and resources.

We think this is interesting because it’s a real problem that affects how well these companies work and how safe they are. By creating a C++ program that models how to manage vehicles using object-oriented programming, we practice important ideas like inheritance and aggregation. At the same time, we show how software can help organize things better and avoid human mistakes.

Many transportation companies, especially small and medium-sized ones, still use old methods like Excel spreadsheets or outdated software to manage important information about their vehicles, drivers, and routes. These methods are often slow and prone to mistakes because they rely on people to enter data manually. For example, itâ€™s easy to forget when a vehicle needs maintenance or to mix up which driver is assigned to which vehicle. Sometimes important information gets lost or written incorrectly, which can cause confusion.

These problems can lead to bigger issues for the company. If vehicles are not maintained on time, they can break down or cause accidents. If drivers are assigned incorrectly, it can slow down deliveries or trips, and this wastes both time and money. Overall, these mistakes affect how well the company works and can even make the transportation process unsafe for workers and customers.

To help solve these problems, this project is a simple C++ program that uses object-oriented programming (OOP) to manage a small group of vehicles and drivers. Object-oriented programming means we create parts of the program called classes that represent real-world things like cars, drivers, and routes. Each class holds related information and actions.

The program includes these parts:
Vehicle: saves info like license plate, vehicle type, and maintenance status.
Driver: stores driver name, license number, and assigned vehicle.
Route: contains origin, destination, distance, and travel time.
FleetManager: connects all parts and lets users add vehicles and drivers, assign drivers to vehicles, create routes, and check maintenance status.

The goal is to organize the transport system and avoid human mistakes.

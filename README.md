# TransporTEC

Many transport companies, especially small and medium ones, still use old ways like Excel sheets or old software to keep track of their vehicles, drivers, and routes. These ways are often slow and can cause mistakes because people have to enter data by hand. For example, it’s easy to forget when a vehicle needs fixing or to mix up which driver drives which vehicle. Sometimes important information gets lost or written wrong, which can cause confusion.

These problems can cause bigger troubles for the company. If vehicles are not fixed on time, they might break down or cause accidents. If drivers are assigned the wrong vehicles, deliveries or trips can be slow, wasting time and money. Overall, these mistakes make the company work worse and can make transport unsafe for workers and customers.

To help fix these problems, this project is a simple C++ program that uses object-oriented programming (OOP). OOP means the program has parts called classes that represent real things like cars, drivers, and routes. Each class holds related information and actions.

The program has these parts:

Vehicle: stores details like license plate, type, and maintenance info.

Driver: stores the driver’s name, license number, and the vehicle they drive.

Route: holds where the trip starts, where it ends, distance, and travel time.

FleetManager: connects all parts and lets users add vehicles and drivers, assign drivers to vehicles, create routes, and check maintenance.

The goal is to organize the transport system better and avoid mistakes caused by people.

# TransporTEC

Many transport companies, especially small and medium ones, still use old ways like Excel or old software to manage their vehicles and drivers. These ways are slow and can cause mistakes because people have to enter information by hand. For example, it’s easy to forget when a vehicle needs maintenance or mix up which driver is assigned to which vehicle. Sometimes important information is lost or written wrong, causing confusion.

These problems can cause bigger troubles. If vehicles don’t get maintenance on time, they might break down or cause accidents. If drivers are assigned to the wrong vehicles, deliveries and trips can be delayed, wasting time and money. Overall, these mistakes hurt how well the company works and can make transport unsafe for workers and customers.

To help with this, this project is a simple C++ program using object-oriented programming. It has classes for vehicles, drivers, and maintenance. Each class holds the right information and helps organize it.

The program has these parts:

Vehicle: stores details like brand, model, year, and maintenance info.

Driver: stores the driver’s name and the vehicle they drive.

Maintenance: keeps track of the last maintenance date and status of a vehicle.

Car and Truck: special types of vehicles with extra details like number of seats or load capacity.

FleetManager (conceptual): connects all parts and helps manage the vehicles and drivers, assign drivers to vehicles, and check maintenance.

The program lets you see details about cars and trucks and who drives them, making it easier to avoid mistakes and keep the transport running smoothly.
